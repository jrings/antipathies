# antipathies
Try to install Python github repositories and tell you if it works

When Alice went down the rabbit hole, she thought:
"Presently she began again. "I wonder if I shall fall fight through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards! The antipathies, I think-" (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word)"

Like going down the rabbit hole, or shaving a yak, trying to install projects from Github is an exercise in futility, as all too often the requirements don't work, are not specified, or something else happens that keeps you from installing the code. This library tries its best to do as much as possible for you.
